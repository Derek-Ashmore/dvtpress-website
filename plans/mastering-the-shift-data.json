This book strips away the hype, jargon, and fleeting tool-specific tutorials to teach the timeless principles that let you collaborate effectively with AI coding agents.",
  "extended_description": "Stop watching other developers deliver features faster while you struggle with the same old workflows. If you've noticed colleagues completing tasks in hours that take you days, they're not necessarily smarterâ€”they've learned to work effectively with AI coding tools.
