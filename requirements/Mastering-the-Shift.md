## Description
**Adapt or Die:** The truth is, developers who resist AI are falling behind. This agentic engineering book strips away the hype, jargon, and fleeting tool-specific tutorials to teach the timeless principles that let you collaborate effectively with AI coding agents.

**Use teams of AI Agents to produce more at a higher quality.** The world has evolved from managing smaller tasks using one AI agent, as we do using GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Claude Code. Now, we're using entire teams of AI agents to tackle larger and more complex projects.

## Details
**Stop watching other developers deliver features faster while you struggle with the same old workflows.**

If you've noticed colleagues completing tasks in hours that take you days, they're not necessarily smarter—they've learned to work effectively with AI coding tools. While you're still debating whether agentic engineering is "real programming," they're leveraging Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and/or ChatGPT to solve bigger problems and advance their careers.

**The uncomfortable truth: Developers who refuse to adapt to AI tools are falling behind.**

This book cuts through the complexity and academic theory that plague most AI resources. Instead of overwhelming you with sophisticated frameworks and prompt engineering jargon, you'll learn the straightforward principles that actually work in real development environments.

**This isn't about becoming dependent on AI—it's about becoming more capable with it than you ever were without it.** You'll preserve the craftsmanship and problem-solving skills that make programming rewarding while gaining the productivity advantages that modern development demands.

No tool-specific tutorials that become obsolete in months. No complex prompting strategies you'll never remember. Just the timeless principles that will serve you whether you're using today's AI tools or whatever replaces them tomorrow.

**Your choice is simple:** Learn to collaborate effectively with AI coding agents now, or watch your career stagnate while others accelerate past you. The shift is happening with or without you.

### What You'll Learn
- Simple, effective techniques for working with AI coding assistants
- When to trust AI suggestions and when to ignore them
- How to maintain code quality while dramatically increasing productivity  
- Practical workflows that integrate seamlessly with your existing development process
- The mindset shifts that separate successful AI-assisted developers from those left behind


### Who This Book Is For
**Perfect for developers and team leads who:**
- Recognize the software development landscape is changing rapidly and want to stay ahead
- Have been hesitant about AI tools but are ready to embrace practical advantages
- Notice colleagues delivering features faster and suspect they're using AI effectively
- Want to future-proof their careers without losing programming craftsmanship
- Are concerned about job security in an AI-driven future
- Are open to changing how they approach problem-solving and code creation

**Ideal if you:**
- Have basic programming experience in any modern language (Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, etc.)
- Want practical guidance over academic theory
- Prefer simple approaches that consistently work over complex systems
- Value productivity gains without sacrificing code quality
- Are willing to experiment with new workflows

**Not suitable if you:**
- Expect detailed tool setup tutorials and configuration guides
- Want step-by-step walkthroughs for specific AI platforms
- Prefer theoretical frameworks over practical implementation
- Want to avoid changing your current development approach

**Career levels:** Junior developers looking to accelerate growth, mid-level developers wanting to stay competitive, and senior professionals adapting to industry evolution will all find value in these practical approaches to AI-assisted development.
